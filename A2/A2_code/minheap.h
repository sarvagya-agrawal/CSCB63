/******************************** <READ ME> ***********************************

In order to be able to implement the `decrease_priority()` function for a heap
in O(log n) time, we need to be able to able to retrieve the index of an 
the value in the heap in O(1) time. In a naive implementation, this is not 
possible to do without a linear scan of the heap (which is O(n)).  

In our case, the keys (values) will only be integer values from [0-MAXSIZE], 
where  MAXSIZE could be the total number of pixels in an image. 
So, we can store an array of MAXSIZE integers inside the heap such that: 

    heap->indices[v] == index in the heap array of the value `v`

Initially we will set all the values in this indices array to -1, and we will
update the corresponding indices whenever a new element is inserted, removed,
or swapped around as a result of the heap-operations.

// One node of the heap
typedef struct {
  int val;
  double priority;
} HeapElement;

// Array representation of the heap, with some metadata
typedef struct {
  int numItems;       // Number of items currently in the heap
  int maxSize;           // Total (maximum) size of the heap 
  
  HeapElement *arr;   // The actual array representing the minHeap
  int *indices;       // indices[key] = index of key in `arr`, or -1
} MinHeap;

// Allocate and free
MinHeap *newMinHeap(int maxSize);
void freeHeap(MinHeap *heap);

// Core heap functions...

int heapExtractMin(MinHeap *heap, double *priority);
void heapDecreasePriority(MinHeap *heap, int val, double priority);
